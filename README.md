Income Prediction Project
This project predicts the income of individuals using a machine learning model. The prediction is based on various features such as age, education, occupation, etc.

Project Overview
This project uses a dataset to train a machine learning model to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year. The model is deployed as a web application where users can input the required features and get predictions.

Files in the Repository
adult_copy.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
model.pkl: The serialized machine learning model.
model.py: The Python script containing the code to train the model.
script.py: The Flask application script that serves the web interface for predictions.
.github/workflows/deploy.yml: The GitHub Actions workflow file for automated deployment.
README.md: This file, containing details about the project.
How to Run the Project Locally
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask
scikit-learn
pandas
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/rocky297/income_prediction.git
cd income_prediction
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python script.py
Open your web browser and go to:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
You should see the web interface where you can input data and get predictions.

Deployment
This project is configured to be automatically deployed using GitHub Actions. The workflow file is located in .github/workflows/deploy.yml. The deployment details depend on the platform you are using (e.g., GitHub Pages, Heroku, Render).

Usage
Web Interface: After running the Flask application, you can input features such as age, education, and occupation through the web interface to get predictions on whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000.
